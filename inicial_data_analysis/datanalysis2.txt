if one needs to change a document but doesnt want to change the
original data ( which happenbs when assigning a new variable to it directly)
i.e: data (var 1, data"base")
section = data[something] -> changes made in section are going to be kept
at data (original)
to avoid it, 
section = data[something].copy() | creating a copy makes it so that changes
in section don't impact the original. 

digitize -> sorting data in categories 
i.e categories  = np.array([2,4,6,8])
categories from 0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8 
(analyzes data from data to check which category it fits)
